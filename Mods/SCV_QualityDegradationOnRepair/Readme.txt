New version of Quality Degradation.

Items degrade at a flat 10 levels per repair.
The flat 10 is adjusted by "AS_MiningTools_Lvl" skills. For every 10 lvls of mining action skill a user has they improve the item quality degradation by 1 point. So if you have mining at lvl 23 say you only lose 8 quality each time you repair an item instead of the standard 10.
Items do no break (except under extreme circumstances, see below)
Minimum quality is 10 (unless the item is already below 10 and hence will just stay at whatever quality it was created with)
If the item is at minimum or below quality (i.e. 10 or below) and on zero durability and you repair the item it is deleted ! It also plays the Break noise :)
Mod slots are now reduced as the quality declines by repair. The number of mod slots match the normal rules for number of mod slots vs quality (TBC, see how many mod slots there are for items when creating them).
If a mod slot is lost during repair and a mod is in the slot we attempt to return the mod to the players inventory, if all bag/toolbelt slots are full the mod is dropped on the floor.
