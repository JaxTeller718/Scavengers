  Makes the simulation persistent, if you want to wipe/restart the simulation there are two choices:
  1: The plugin has a command to reset the simulation: "walkersim reset"
  2: You can delete the simulation data located at your save path named WalkerSim.bin
  NOTE: Turning this off will always restart the simulation whenever the server restarts.

    Divides the entire map into zones, the zone divider is used on each axis (xy).

    Chance the offline zombie will travel to a POI rather than a world zone.
